#Common Moves in Podcasting
For the genre of sports, specifically fighting/entertainment, I picked podcasts on the UFC and WWE. Taekwondo black belt and current UFC commentator Joe Rogan host one show and long-time WWE fans Steve and Larson host the other. Though each host(s) have other works, their podcasts tend to have  similarities or "common moves" that any podcaster can learn from.

##Joe Rogan Experience (PowerfulJRE)

###Episodes Watched  
-Joe Rogan Experience #890 - Fight Breakdown  
-Joe Rogan Experience #893 - Fight Recap  

###Common Moves
####Organization
The storage of all Rogan's podcasts is set-up as a typical YouTube channel. There are navigation links on his YouTube Page [Joe Rogan's YouTube Page](https://www.youtube.com/user/PowerfulJRE) ranging from:  
-home  
-the newest videos at the top to the oldest at the bottom  
-playlists of the various projects Rogan has  
-channels he likes  
-discussion  
-about  

####Host  
-Joe Rogan hosts every episode and has at least one guest (two for these two episodes).

####Guest
Brendan Schaub and Eddie Bravo are the guests on each of these episodes (though the Joey Diaz is an additional guest on episode 893).

####Intro
-Both podcast had the same logo of a painted face of Joe Rogan spinning as you hear the host speaking before the video is up to open the podcast.  

-Rogan now welcomes his guests by name, starting the podcast.

####Common theme, getting off topic
-Both podcasts see the group talk in a very conversational tone.

-Both see the guests talk about fighting in some regard from the very beginning. Episode 890 has the viewer hearing how many fighters are bland now-a-days before later showing actual Boxing/UFC fights, and installment 893 describes the shocking Rhonda Rousey loss, showing the fight to viewers.  

-Yet both podcasts show a tendency to get off topic, as a friends together may do, such as Rogan talking about fighters' drug use at the end of 893.

####Wrap-Up
-Joe ends each podcast by stating his guests again by name and saying, "thank you."

-He then states when his show will be back and who his next guest(s) will be.

##Steve and Larson's Going In Raw

-The Wyatt Era Begins. WWE Smackdown Live Review & Results (Going in Raw Ep. 171)

###Common Movies
####Organization
The storage of all the podcasts is set-up just as the Joe Rogan Experience. There are navigation links on Steve and Larson's YouTube Page [Steve and Larson's YouTube Page](https://www.youtube.com/user/SteveAndLarson) that include:     
-home  
-the newest videos at the top to the oldest at the bottom  
-playlists of the various projects the duo has  
-channels they like   
-discussion  
-about

####Hosts
-The podcast itself is set-up with the same hosts on every episode. Though guest Dan cubed may sometimes appear, he is not in these two installments.  

####Intro
Each video of Going In Raw starts the same way:  

-The viewer will see both Steve in Larson in a still picture before a promo sound byte of host Steve starts.   

-The audio clip reads:
>"Be apart of the best pro wrestling podcast today by supporting the Going In Raw patron. You can enjoy the live taping of the show, exclusive merchandise and patron only episode side and so much more. Support Going In Raw today; click the link in the description."  

-From one sound byte to another, the viewer now hears and sees multiple WWE Superstars stating one is watching "Going in Raw" and or "Smackdown Live (another show owned by WWE)," as a joke. After the audio and video fades out, now one sees a Steve and Larson in a live set-up.  

-Steve then lists all the places their podcasts are available such as Soundcloud, Facebook, etc., listing benefits of being a patron, and then moving into the new content of the show.

####Flow
-Content of the show is organized as the two men recap and offer insight of the past show, whether it is Raw for episode 170 or Smackdown for episode 171.  

-They go match-by-match, or promo, in chronological order of what happened first to last.  For episode 170 this is the debut of Emmalina and for installment 171 this is the entrance of new champion Bray Wyatt.

-As Steve and Larson rehash, they also offer their insight and relay similar past instances in WWE they see that are related.

By going in order, the duo keeps the viewer interested building the same excitement the show/pay-per-view had. The viewer likely knows what was happened in the WWE's program, so by offering insight and talking about past instances, at the same time, adds the appeal a talk-show host or podcaster needs.  

####Conclusion
-The show then shifts to the duo reading and answering questions from fans and patrons.

####Sound
-As mentioned, Going In Raw has the sound bytes of Steve asking for patron support and superstars welcoming the viewer to the show with background music that fades out. Outside of this usage, there is no more Foley or sound additions; the duo even read the questions they answer in the latter half of the podcast. Instead, it is left to Steve and Larson to themselves to entertain the lister.

-The two describing past examples and their opinions on the match results are again key as they captivate the viewer who is staring at two men talking behind a desk. Steve and Larson also do a great job coming across conversational and as like they are simply talking without a script; though the two may mention their notes.

####Narrative
-The narrative of the show is simply two men talking back and forth in a conversation. They have an order of matches and promos to talk about, but go off on adding what they think by each segment and overall of the previous event. Though they may go off topic, it is education and captivating to the audience, who likely want different angels about watches the WWE show.
